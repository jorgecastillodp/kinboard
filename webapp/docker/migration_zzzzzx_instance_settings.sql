-- Settings of the install rather than of a family. For now one: the server's
-- own time zone (`server_timezone`), which the webapp's entrypoint writes from
-- its TZ on every start, so the database falls back to the same zone as the
-- rest of the server -- lib/family-time.ts uses process.env.TZ -- for a family
-- that has not picked one (#341), instead of Europe/Berlin.
--
-- Read by SECURITY DEFINER functions and the service role only: no policy, so
-- the browser roles see nothing.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run. Sorts before migration_zzzzzy_todo_turns.sql,
-- whose family_time_zone() reads it.
